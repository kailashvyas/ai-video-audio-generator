# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project is an AI-powered content generation system that automatically creates complete multimedia content packages including ideas, scripts, videos, and audio using Google's Gemini API suite. The system allows users to generate professional-quality content with configurable video scene limits to manage API usage costs while maintaining creative control over the output.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to generate a complete content idea with a detailed script, so that I can quickly produce engaging multimedia content without manual brainstorming.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a topic or theme THEN the system SHALL generate a creative content idea using Gemini API
2. WHEN an idea is generated THEN the system SHALL create a detailed script with scene descriptions, dialogue, and visual cues
3. WHEN a script is created THEN the system SHALL structure it with clear scene breaks and timing information
4. IF no topic is provided THEN the system SHALL generate a random trending topic suggestion

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to automatically generate videos from my script using Veo, so that I can create visual content without manual video editing skills.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a script is finalized THEN the system SHALL parse scene descriptions and generate video prompts for Veo
2. WHEN generating videos THEN the system SHALL respect the user-configured maximum number of scenes per run
3. WHEN the scene limit is reached THEN the system SHALL provide options to continue with remaining scenes or complete the current batch
4. WHEN videos are generated THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent visual style and character descriptions across all scenes
5. WHEN creating video prompts THEN the system SHALL include detailed character descriptions in every prompt to ensure consistency
6. WHEN character consistency is critical THEN the system SHALL optionally generate reference images first and use image-to-video generation
7. IF video generation fails THEN the system SHALL retry with modified prompts and log the error

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to generate synchronized audio narration and background music, so that my videos have professional-quality sound design.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a script contains dialogue THEN the system SHALL generate natural-sounding narration using Gemini's text-to-speech capabilities
2. WHEN generating audio THEN the system SHALL create appropriate background music that matches the content mood
3. WHEN audio is created THEN the system SHALL synchronize narration timing with video scene durations
4. WHEN multiple audio tracks exist THEN the system SHALL mix them with appropriate volume levels
5. IF audio generation fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback options or silent video output

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a budget-conscious user, I want to control my API usage costs, so that I can manage my expenses while still creating quality content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting a generation run THEN the system SHALL allow users to specify maximum number of Veo video scenes
2. WHEN the scene limit is set THEN the system SHALL display estimated API costs before proceeding
3. WHEN API limits are reached THEN the system SHALL pause and request user confirmation to continue
4. WHEN a run completes THEN the system SHALL display actual API usage and costs incurred
5. IF usage approaches user-defined budget limits THEN the system SHALL warn the user before proceeding

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to automatically integrate all generated assets into a final video, so that I can have a complete, ready-to-publish multimedia piece.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all assets are generated THEN the system SHALL automatically combine videos, audio, and timing into a final output
2. WHEN integrating assets THEN the system SHALL ensure proper synchronization between video scenes and audio tracks
3. WHEN the final video is created THEN the system SHALL provide multiple output formats (MP4, WebM, etc.)
4. WHEN integration is complete THEN the system SHALL generate a project summary with all source materials and metadata
5. IF integration fails THEN the system SHALL provide individual assets for manual assembly

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to ensure character and visual consistency across all generated content, so that my videos maintain professional quality and narrative coherence.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating multiple scenes THEN the system SHALL maintain a character description database for the current project
2. WHEN creating video prompts THEN the system SHALL automatically include relevant character descriptions from the database
3. WHEN character consistency is prioritized THEN the system SHALL offer image-to-video generation as an alternative workflow
4. WHEN using image-to-video THEN the system SHALL first generate reference character images using Gemini's image generation
5. WHEN reference images exist THEN the system SHALL use them as input for Veo's image-to-video capabilities
6. IF character descriptions change mid-project THEN the system SHALL update the database and warn about potential inconsistencies

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a portfolio showcaser, I want to demonstrate the system's capabilities and my technical skills, so that potential employers can see my AI integration and automation abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system runs THEN it SHALL log detailed process information showing AI integration complexity
2. WHEN content is generated THEN the system SHALL showcase multiple Gemini API integrations (text, video, audio, image)
3. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL highlight technical achievements like automated workflow orchestration
4. WHEN sharing the project THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive documentation of architecture and API usage
5. IF demonstrating to others THEN the system SHALL provide sample outputs that showcase the full pipeline capabilities
