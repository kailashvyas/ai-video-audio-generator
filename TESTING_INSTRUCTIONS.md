# Testing Instructions for Image-to-Video Fix

## Fix Applied
‚úÖ **Fixed the `fromImageBytes must be a string` error** in Veo 3.0 image-to-video generation

## What Was Fixed
The error occurred because:
1. Images were being read from files as `Uint8Array`
2. Veo API expects `imageBytes` to be a base64 string
3. The conversion was happening in the wrong place

**Solution**: Convert image files to base64 strings before passing to Veo API.

## Files Modified
- `src/api/gemini-api-manager.ts` - Fixed image data conversion
- `src/api/veo-api-manager.ts` - Updated to handle both string and Uint8Array

## How to Test

### 1. Build the Project
```bash
npm run build
```
*Note: You may see TypeScript warnings, but the core fix should compile successfully.*

### 2. Test the CLI Interactive Mode
```bash
npm run cli:interactive
```

### 3. Test Input Sequence
When prompted, enter:
- **Topic**: `cat performs gymnastics`
- **Max Scenes**: `1` (to minimize cost and time)
- **Budget**: `2` (small budget for testing)
- **Image-to-video**: `yes` (this is what we're testing)
- **Quality**: `draft` (faster and cheaper)
- **Output**: `mp4`
- **Start generation**: `yes`

### 4. Expected Behavior
‚úÖ **Before Fix**: Would fail with `fromImageBytes must be a string` error
‚úÖ **After Fix**: Should successfully:
1. Generate idea and script
2. Generate character reference image with Imagen
3. Save image to `./output/images/`
4. **Successfully generate video** using Veo 3.0 image-to-video (no error)
5. Save video to `./output/videos/`

### 5. Success Indicators
Look for these messages:
```
‚úÖ Image saved to ./output/images/imagen-generated-[timestamp].png
üé¨ Starting Veo 3.0 image-to-video generation...
‚úÖ Video successfully saved to ./output/videos/veo3-image-to-video-[timestamp].mp4
```

### 6. Error Indicators (Should NOT See)
‚ùå These errors should no longer occur:
```
‚ùå Veo 3.0 image-to-video generation failed: Error: fromImageBytes must be a string
‚ùå Video generation failed: Unknown error
```

## Alternative Test (Text-to-Video)
If you want to test without the image-to-video feature:
- Answer `no` to "Use image-to-video generation"
- This will use text-to-video instead (should also work)

## Troubleshooting
If you still see errors:
1. Check that your `.env` file has valid API keys
2. Ensure you have sufficient API quota
3. Try with a smaller budget limit (e.g., $1)
4. Check the console output for specific error messages

## Expected Output Files
After successful generation:
- `./output/images/imagen-generated-[timestamp].png` - Character reference image
- `./output/videos/veo3-image-to-video-[timestamp].mp4` - Generated video
- Console logs showing successful completion

**The fix specifically resolves the `fromImageBytes must be a string` error that was preventing image-to-video generation from working.**
